Microsite project on the topic SpaceX/FH (Falcon Heavy)

A microsite that will display spaceX launches (74 launches) 64 is demo test launches.

Version 0.3

- added regex to call 2 action where user can enter email adresse to be notofied about next event.
regex works like this is will let the user know if the feild is not valid it must contain:

firstname.lastname @ domain (com.net,se,no,dk, uk, etc)
user@domain.xx

if the user types name and nothing else or @ the user will get a error in the error ID in red text telling the user it must enter
a valid email adress.
